# blockchainVoting
This is a basic voting website. It uses smartcontract on local blockchain to make process more secure 

## working
This website works on local blockchain(HARDHAT)
Smart contract is deployed on local chain and connected to website using web3.js
then metamask is enabled using correct button

then one can check weather his address is verified to vote or not
if you have verification
you can vote

if you dont have verification, wait till admin verifies your ethereum address

check again, and vote

## admin 
admin can verifiy addresses, but he must use same address he used to deploy the smart contract
for security purposes.
